	<p>Hybrid cars are better</p>
	<blockquote cite="https://www.acko.com/car-guide/what-is-hybrid-car-hybrid-vs-electric-cars-advantages/">
	Hybrid cars are powered by two engines: one petrol, one electric. Both work with each other to spin the wheels.
	This leads to lesser petrol being burned and therefore better fuel efficiency. When compared to conventional vehicles,
	hybrids offer better power and fuel efficiency as they combine the benefits of high fuel efficiency and low emissions.
	When hybrid vehicles are cruising or while braking, the result is excess power which is used to charge the batteries. 
	This, in turn, aids higher fuel efficiency or range.
